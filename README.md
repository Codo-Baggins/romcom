## Introduction
  - The main goal of this project was to use JavaScript to create a website that generates unique romance novel covers. 
  - Added features include:
    - Generating random covers
    - Creating self made covers
    - Saving previously generated covers
    - Deleting unwanted covers by selecting them

## Process
  1. Iteration 0
    - Generating a random cover once the page loaded  
    - Using querySelector to access HTML elements

  2. Iteration 1
    - Accessing the Show New Random Cover Button
    - Generating a random cover upon that button click

    ![Random Cover](/readme_gifs/readme_gifs/random_button_cover_gif.gif)

  3. Iteration 2
    - Working with the other buttons on the page to display the correct contents
    - Utilizing classList to toggle CSS selectors within the HTML

  4. Iteration 3
    - Generate a new cover based on user inputs 
    - Display the user generated cover

  5. Iteration 4
    - Use JavaScript to append HTML elements 
    - Invoke the addSavedCoversToSave and createSavedCovers functions to display the saved covers selected by the user

    ![Save Covers](/readme_gifs/save_covers_gif.gif)

  6. Iteration 5 
    - Use an eventListener to remove saved covers when a double click event is triggered

    ![Delete Cover](/readme_gifs/Delete_covers_gif.gif)

  7. Future Iterations
    - Create personalized profile functionality for a user to store their saved covers for future use
